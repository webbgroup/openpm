What is OpenPM (Open Property Management)

OpenPM is a website management interface to manage Real Estate as a web portal that is based off of CodeIgnitor.

OpenPM is designed for:
	- Real Estate Brokers (Commercial and Residential)
	- Real Estate Agents (Commercial and Residential)
	- Real Estate Managers (Commercial and Residential)
	- Real Estate Investors

OpenPM allows the website owners to publish/broadcast their properties to the Internet so that website 
aggregators like PropBot.com to retrieve that information and advertise those properties.

OpenPM also allows the end user to redesign the website as their own and come up with their own theme.

OpenPM allows maximum flexibility in the listings as it covers the market segments:
	- Website Browser User (someone visiting your website from a computer)
	- Website Phone User (someone visiting your website from a mobile phone)
	- Website Tablet User (someone visiting your website from a tablet)
	- Several file exports in multiple formats (so website aggregators to collect your property to search/advertise)

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.
